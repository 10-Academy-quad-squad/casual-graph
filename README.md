A common frustration in the industry, especially when it comes to getting business insights from tabular data, is that the most interesting questions (from their perspective) are often not answerable with observational data alone. These questions can be similar to:
- “What will happen if I halve the price of my product?”
- “Which clients will pay their debts only if I call them?”
